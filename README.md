## Hello Web App: Intro to Web App Development Using Python and Django

This is the GitHub repository for [HelloWebApp.com](http://hellowebapp.com)'s
files. 

Hello Web App is a book series dedicated to teaching beginner web app
development. Written by a designer, it focuses on teaching the websites and
templates first, slowly adding programming concepts over time -- perfect for
anyone who is new to programming or has a background in web design.

See [HelloWebApp.com](http://hellowebapp.com) for how to order (starts at $14.95
for eBook files), a blog with additional tutorials, and more information.

### Background on Hello Web App 

In January 2011, [I taught myself Python and Django and launched my first web app in six weeks](http://www.limedaring.com/im-a-designer-who-learned-django-and-launched-her-first-webapp-in-6-weeks/).

Three years later, this web app has evolved into my startup, [WeddingLovely](http://weddinglovely.com) (a part of [500 Startups](http://500.co) and the [Designer Fund](http://designerfund.com)) - I've designed and built the entire company and LOVE web app development!

Learning to code was so frustrating, especially as a right-brained designer with no back-end programming experience. Tutorials assumed I was comfortable with the command line, knew what a model-view-template architecture was, and already had a grasp on programming tools and resources. 

I want to build a introduction to web app programming using Django and Python
which assumes absolutely no programming knowledge - down-to-earth explanations
of programming terms and basic walkthroughs of using important programming
utilities like git (for version control), GitHub (for backups), virtualenv (for
virtual environments), and others. I also wanted to emphasize templates first -
getting to the visual, web-app view first to see results rather than using the
command line.

[Hello Web App](http://hellowebapp.com/original) launched in May 2015 after a
successful Kickstarter campaign. The book walks
readers through creating a basic web app, from ideation to deployment.

[Hello Web App: Intermediate
Concepts](http://hellowebapp.com/intermediate-concepts) launched December 2015
after another successful Kickstarter campaign (thanks again!) HWA:IC is for
anyone who has a basic web app and would like to build more advanced features
like adding payments with Stripe, user-uploaded images, an API, and more.
