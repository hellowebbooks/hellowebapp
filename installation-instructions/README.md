## Python and Django installation instructions

We'll need to install Python, Django, and a few other utilities to your computer
before being able to build our web app!

### Installing Python

Unfortunately, unlike making web pages with HTML, we need to install some things before our computers can run the files that we're building.

* [Windows](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/blob/master/installation-instructions/python-installation-windows.md)
* Linux (coming soon - [in the meanwhile, use this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/).)

### Installing Virtualenv

This allows us to create a "bubble" around our projects so our various installs
won't conflict.

### Installing Django

Last but not least, let's install Django so we can start building web apps!
