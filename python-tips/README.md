## Python requirements

It seems a bit backwards to require Python knowledge for a beginner web app
tutorial, but the amount you'll need to know is actually very little.

Python is the programming language this course is based on, and Django is the
Python framework which we'll be learning in this tutorial.

I learned the basics of Python and programming logic from Learn Python the Hard
Way (which is a very misleading title) and encourage you to do the same:

[http://learnpythonthehardway.org/](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

The HTML is free online and is more than sufficient, but if you wish, you can
purchase the course for $29.59 and get PDFs and videos as well.

Try to get through at least exercise 40 which'll give you the basic knowledge of
the concepts we need. Don't worry if you're not 100% confident (or even 50%),
the more you work on your web app using this tutorial, the more you'll get.

### Python concepts

Basically, you need to know enough Python to grasp these concepts:

    # Comments (this is an example of one.)

    # Variables:
    object = ""

    # Loops:
    for thing in group:
        # do something to thing

    # If statements:
    if object == thing:
        # do something
    elif object != thing:
        # do something else
    else:
        # do something different too

Again, try to get through at least exercise 40 of [Learn Python the Hard
Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) before picking up Hello Web App.
